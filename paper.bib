	abstract = {Are neural oscillations biologically endowed building blocks of the neural architecture for speech processing from birth, or do they require experience to emerge? In adults, delta, theta, and low-gamma oscillations support the simultaneous processing of phrasal, syllabic, and phonemic units in the speech signal, respectively. Using electroencephalography to investigate neural oscillations in the newborn brain we reveal that delta and theta oscillations differ for rhythmically different languages, suggesting that these bands underlie newborns’ universal ability to discriminate languages on the basis of rhythm. Additionally, higher theta activity during post-stimulus as compared to pre-stimulus rest suggests that stimulation after-effects are present from birth.},

	abstract = {The use of subword units for language modelling tasks is widespread. But, Indic languages have a complex compound script (abugida script), which renders UTF-8-based subword units inefficient. We explore the use of orthographic syllables as the basic sub-word unit for Indic languages to be used for language modelling tasks. We propose Orthographic Syllable Pair Encoding (OSPE) to encode text data for use in Large Language Models. The intuition behind this is to use the natural subword unit in Indic scripts, the Orthographic Syllable, as the basic subword unit for the model instead of UTF-8 characters, which do not quite match the phonemic shapes of Indic languages, leading to the generation of semantically incorrect characters. We compare OSPE to other subword-based encoding techniques, and we find that models trained with data encoded with OSPE outperform the other subword models on language modelling tasks. For example OSPE showed a 30\% improvement in compression ratio over BPE.},

These words were matched to words that were bi-syllables both phonologically and orthographically (e.g. balcon = [bal.kõ] and bal.con). The results on letter stroke duration and ﬂuency yielded signiﬁcant peaks at the syllable boundary for both types of words, indicating that the children use orthographic rather than phonological syllables as processing units to program the words they write.},

	abstract = {Language is composed of small building blocks, which combine to form larger meaningful structures. To understand language, we must process, track and concatenate these building blocks into larger linguistic units as speech unfolds over time. An influential idea is that phase-locking of neural oscillations across different levels of linguistic structure provides a mechanism for this process. Building on this framework, the goal of the current study was to determine whether neural phase-locking occurs more robustly to novel linguistic items that are successfully learned and encoded into memory, compared to items that are not learned. Participants listened to a continuous speech stream composed of repeating nonsense words while their EEG was recorded, and then performed a recognition test on the component words. Neural phase-locking to individual words during the learning period strongly predicted the strength of subsequent word knowledge, suggesting that neural phase-locking indexes the subjective perception of specific linguistic items during real-time language learning. These findings support neural oscillatory models of language, demonstrating that words that are successfully perceived as functional units are tracked by oscillatory activity at the matching word rate. In contrast, words that are not learned are processed merely as a sequence of unrelated syllables, and thus not tracked by corresponding word-rate oscillations.},

	abstract = {Introduction
Studies conducted in recent decades have led to the development of instructional interventions to help prevent or eliminate a large proportion of reading difficulties. However, few experiments have been conducted in French schools.
Objective
Aims for this research were to create, implement and evaluate a remediation program for French students with reading difficulties up to the end of elementary school.
Method
This paper examines the effects of a decoding-skills and fluency-based intervention on 133 struggling readers in second- to fifth-grade. Depending on the nature of their reading difficulties, students were given a year-long training based either on grapho-syllabic conversion — focusing on syllable units, rather than phonemic units, is considered a promising way of helping French-speaking beginning readers — or on repeated reading techniques, used to improve fluency.
Results
Increases in written-word identification scores were greater for students who followed the program than they were for a control group of 184 students with reading difficulties who did not follow the program.
Conclusion
The results show that programs combining early evaluation of written-word identification abilities followed by a year-long series of remediation sessions focusing on specific difficulties can help students progress in written-word identification. However, further research is needed to examine why our program was less effective with children from disadvantaged (“éducation prioritaire”) areas.
Résumé
Introduction
Alors que les programmes d’aide destinés aux apprentis-lecteurs en difficulté et validés par la recherche se multiplient Outre-Atlantique, ils sont encore rares en langue française.
Objectif
La présente étude vise à concevoir, à mettre en œuvre et à analyser les effets d’un programme d’aide à l’identification des mots et à la fluence auprès d’élèves français du CE1 au CM2.
Méthode
Cent trente-trois élèves présentant des difficultés dans l’identification de mots écrits ont participé à cette étude. En fonction de leur profil, les élèves du groupe expérimental ont bénéficié pendant une année scolaire soit d’un entraînement à la conversion grapho-syllabique — approche considérée comme prometteuse en langue française — soit d’un entraînement à la fluence.
Résultats
Les résultats laissent apparaître des gains en identification de mots écrits plus importants pour le groupe expérimental que pour le groupe contrôle, constitué de 184 élèves qui n’ont pas bénéficié de ce programme.
Conclusion
Les résultats indiquent que la mise en place d’un programme combinant une évaluation précoce des habiletés en identification de mots et une remédiations axée sur la difficulté des élèves peut aider ces derniers à progresser dans l’identification de mots écrits. Reste à poursuivre ces travaux afin d’élucider les raisons pour lesquelles les effets de ce programme sont moindres en éducation prioritaire.},
